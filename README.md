# Full Layout for AnySoftKeyboard
* A layout and a set of themes for AnySoftKeyboard. The package features 2 layouts (english and russian) optimized for terminal input.
## Features
* The layouts have number keys, various functional keys (tab, ctrl, esc, home, end and arrow keys)
as well as copy, cut, paste keys and a special key to summon AnySoftKeyboard functional overlay.
* All necessary symbols for coding and terminal input are mapped as long-press keys on the layout.
* Set of 6 (light, dark, black and their versions with buttons) themes with smaller, condensed overlay to allow for bigger layouts occupy same space. Themes also feature increased font size for hint characters, since default one is too small.
* All resources are android drawables and paths so it should look good on any pixel density and screen resolution.

## Detailed info
* Both layouts override top and bottom extension rows to add hint symbols and additional keys.
* New themes are intended to be used with new layouts, otherwise hint text size will be too large for stock layouts. You still can use stock themes, though, hint text would be almost unreadable.
