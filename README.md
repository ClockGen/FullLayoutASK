# Full Layout for AnySoftKeyboard
* A layout and set of themes for AnySoftKeyboard. The package features 2 layouts (english and russian) optimized for terminal input.
## Features
* The layouts have number keys, various functional keys (tab, ctrl, esc, home, end and arrow keys)
as well as copy, cut, paste keys and a special key to summon AnySoftKeyboard functional overlay.
* All necessary symbols for coding and terminal input are mapped as long-press keys on the layout.
* Set of basic themes with smaller, condensed overlay to allow for bigger layouts occupy same space. Themes also feature increased font size for hint characters, since default ones are too small.

## Detailed info
* Both layouts override top and bottom extension rows to add hint symbols and additional keys.
* New themes are intended to be used with new layouts, otherwise hint text size will be too large for stock layouts. You still can use stock themes, though, hint text would be almost unreadable.
## Building
This project was made in AIDE, so if building in android studio fails (and most likely it does), open an issue please (or post in already existing one).
## Status
* Right now the project contains only hdpi size resources, so key icons might look a bit blurry on 1920x1080+ resolutions.
* I'm going to add more themes, so if you have any ideas, suggestions and concepts please submit it to issues.
