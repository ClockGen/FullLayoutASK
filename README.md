# Full Layout for AnySoftKeyboard
* A layout and set of themes for AnySoftKeyboard. The package features 2 layouts (english and russian) optimized for terminal input.
## Features
* The layouts have number keys, various functional keys (tab, ctrl, esc, home, end and arrow keys)
as well as copy, cut, paste keys and a special key to summon AnySoftKeyboard functional overlay.
* All necessary symbols for coding and terminal input are mapped as long-press keys on the layout.
* Set of basic themes with smaller, condensed overlay to allow for bigger layouts occupy same space. Themes also feature increased font size for hint characters, since default ones are too small.

## Building
This project was made in AIDE, so if building in android studio fails (and most likely it is), open an issue please (or post in already existing one).
## Status
Right now I only included hdpi size resources, so key icons might look a bit blurry on 1920x1080+ resolutions.
## License
The layout uses various resources (mostly modified icons) from aosp and AnySoftKeyboard, both are licenced under Apache 2 license, full text of which can be found [here](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
